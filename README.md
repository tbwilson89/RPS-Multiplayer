# Rock, Paper, Scissor - Multiplayer
## Overview
An online version of the popular 1 on 1 game Rock, Paper, Scissor!
## Gameplay
Two active slots are available for player one and two, first come first serve!

Once both players are chosen, each player will pick their weapon of choice (at least, from the available options in a typical RPS game), once both players have chosen, the winner is announced to all connected players/viewers!

Each win a player gets will be added to their total wins, and each loss to their total losses. This information is saved as long as the player stays connected, unless they are logged in with their Google account!
## Google Authenticated login
Players may choose to log in with their Google account to have a persistent username and wins/losses when coming and going from the website.
## Chat Available!
What's a multiplayer game without a chat feature to talk with your opponents and viewers?
